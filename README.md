This code implements a Transformer model, a deep learning architecture primarily used in natural language processing tasks like machine translation. 

The Transformer consists of several components:

Layer Normalization: A normalization technique applied to the output of each sub-layer in the Transformer.

Feed Forward Block: A feedforward neural network layer within the Transformer architecture.

Input Embeddings: Embedding layers to convert input tokens into continuous representations.

Positional Encoding: Provides positional information to the input embeddings, allowing the model to understand the order of words in a sequence.

Multi-Head Attention Block: A mechanism that attends to different positions with multiple sets of parameters in parallel, enabling the model to focus on different parts of the input.

Encoder Block: A component of the Transformer encoder, which processes the input sequence.

Encoder: Stacks multiple encoder blocks together to create the encoder part of the Transformer.

Decoder Block: A component of the Transformer decoder, which generates the output sequence.

Decoder: Stacks multiple decoder blocks together to create the decoder part of the Transformer.

Projection Layer: A linear layer followed by a log-softmax operation that maps the model's output to a probability distribution over the vocabulary.

Transformer: Combines the encoder, decoder, and other components into a complete model.
