This Python code performs several data preprocessing and analysis tasks using the pandas, scikit-learn (for PCA), matplotlib, and numpy libraries. Here's a breakdown of each part:

Getting Data: Reads stock data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

Sorting and Identifying Unique Names: Identifies unique names from the 'Name' column of the DataFrame and sorts them alphabetically.

Filtering Data Based on Date Criteria: Removes data entries that fall outside the specified date range (1st July 2014 to 30th June 2017) for each unique name.

Finding Common Dates: Determines the set of dates common to all remaining names after filtering.

Pivoting Data: Creates a pivoted DataFrame where columns represent stock names, rows represent dates, and the values are closing prices.

Calculating Percentage Change: Computes the percentage change in closing prices relative to the previous date for each stock.

Performing PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Applies PCA to the percentage change data to extract principal components, sorts them based on eigenvalues, and prints the top 5 principal components.

Explained Variance Ratios: Calculates and displays the percentage of variance explained by the first principal component and plots the explained variance ratios for the first 20 principal components.

Cumulative Variance Ratios: Computes cumulative variance ratios and plots them, marking the principal component where the cumulative variance ratio is greater than or equal to 95%.

Overall, this code aims to preprocess and analyze stock data, including filtering, calculating percentage changes, and performing PCA to understand the variance explained by different principal components. Additionally, it visualizes the variance ratios and cumulative variance ratios to provide insights into the data's dimensionality and variability.
